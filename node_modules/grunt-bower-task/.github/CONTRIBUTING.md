## How Can I Contribute?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section will guide you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for grunt-bower-task. All enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues][issues]. Before creating a new suggestion we ask that you first check to make sure there is not already an [issue requesting that enhancement][enhancements]. We also ask that you look through any issues with the [roadmap][roadmap-label] label to make sure your request isn't already in the works.

### Your First Code Contribution

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this free series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead-course].

Unsure where to begin contributing to grunt-bower-task? You can start by looking through these `first-timer`, `difficulty:easy` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [First-Timer issues][first-timer] - issues created to help anyone contributing to their first open-source project. (usually contain detailed explanations of the problem and how to fix it)
* [difficulty:easy issues][difficulty:easy] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help Wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `difficulty:easy` issues.

Eash issue lists is sorted by the total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

* Please, use `devel` branch for all pull requests.
* In lieu of a formal style guide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.
* Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.
* Lint and test your code using [Grunt][grunt].

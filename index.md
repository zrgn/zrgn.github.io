# Zargon

## Bylaws

### [Objectives](#objectives)
Good humored, cooperative, competitive, consensual torture, for the purposes of
exploring strategies, design, progress and history of gaming

## [Membership](#membership)
There is no single leader of the Zargon community. Zargon is a community run
effort. All members are encouraged to participate in this effort.

The following guidelines are intended to allow us to maintain an inclusive
environment where all members feel comfortable gaming with any other member of
the group rather than fracturing into cliques. They are enumerated in detail so
as to mitigate subjectivity in role assignment.

### [Obligations](#obligations)
* Members are expected to maintain basic personal hygiene.
* Members are expected to be gracious and respect additional restrictions of
  venue
    - e.g. no smoking inside; no young children; allergy considerations.

### [Active Members](#active-members)
* An active member is one who regularly does one or more of the following:
  - Attends and particpates in scheduled gaming
  - Attends and participates in social events
  - Participates in virtual group conversations (e.g. text, voice, video)
* Active members are noted by the **Zargonaut** role in the group discord.

### [Contributing Members](#contributing-members)
* A contributing member is an active member who also regularly does one or more
 of the following:
  - Schedules game sessions
  - Schedules social events
  - Brings new games for the group to try
  - Teaches games at gaming events
  - Creates content to aid the group (e.g. rules handouts, character
    illustrations, game storage solutions)
  - Contributes to group infrastructure (commits to websites or bots, server
    administration, etc.)
* An active member who feels they are making sufficient contributions should
  bring this to the attention of one of the contributing members.
* Contributing members are noted by the **Adept** role in the group discord.

### [New Members](#new-members)
* Any active member in good standing may invite a non-member to join social
  or gaming events, but takes responsibility for their behavior.
  - In the case of a virtual event, they will be assigned the **Attendee** role
    in the group discord.
  - The **Attendee** role is temporary and will be removed once the event
    concludes.
* Any active member in good standing may nominate a previously-introduced
  individual for full membership.
* A nominated individual will then be considered as follows:
  - Three(3) **Adept** members must vote in the affirmative.
  - A single negative vote will prevent promotion to full membership until it is
    resolved.
    - A member voting in the negative is expected to explain their reasoning to
      the group.
    - If the situation can be resolved to the satisfaction of the voting member,
      they may of course change their vote.
  - **Zargonaut** members are encouraged to give their opinion of the nominee,
    but their vote will not contribute to the three-count. However, a negative
    vote will be strongly considered.

### [Games](#games)
* Exhibit good sportsmanship. Be gracious in both victory and defeat.
* Members shall play to the best of their abilities (and not for the purpose of
  antagonizing or targeting others).
* Cheating is prohibited and viewed as a grievous violation of the Spirit of
  Zargon.
* If after a few initial explanations of a game's rule, a member requires
  continual clarification, that member may be expected to abstain from the game
  until they can master the rules outside of a gaming sessions. Watching video
  tutorials, private study, or explicit "learning games" are the onus of the
  individual, not the community.
* Treat game components with respect and care, especially if it is not your
  game.
* Members shall not repeatedly gripe, grouse, whinge, or whine about the design
  of a game. Members are expected to have the self-awareness to abstain from
  games that they dislike.
* Members seeking to make improvements to a game should offer suggestions
  constructively by making concrete proposals for house rules.

### [Infractions](#infractions)
It is incumbent on members to bring issues to the attention of the community.
An issue can't be addressed if no one else is aware it exists. Ideally, members
should bring up the issue directly with the other member, solving it privately.

If private resolution is unsuccessful or if members are uncomfortable discussing
the matter with the other member, the issue should be brought to the attention
of the [Adepts](#contributing-members) and will move through the conflict
resolution procedure described below.  Note that it is not necessary to relay
the particulars of a conflict to the Adepts in order to begin conflict
resolution.

### [Conflict Resolution](#conflict-resolution)

#### [Mediation](#mediation)
Formal conflict resolution will initially begin with mediation.  A mediator will
be selected from the [Adept](#contributing-members) group either by mutual
agreement between the two conflicting parties or via selection of a
disinterested party by the Adepts.

The mediator facilitates a discussion between the two parties, attempting to
gather facts behind the conflict, and for proposing an amicable solution.
Mediation is expected to remain a private matter between the two parties and the
mediator.  If the two parties are still unable to reach a solution, the process
moves to arbitration.  Arbitration is considered to be a last resort and all
effort should be made to resolve the conflict during mediation.

#### [Arbitration](#arbitration)
Both parties will write a document outlining their version of events and the
nature of the conflict.  Five disinterested adepts (not including the initial
mediator) will be selected at random to serve as arbiters.  The mediator will
present any relevant background and should the arbiters have additional
questions, the mediator may be asked to gather additional information.  The
arbiters will discuss the matter alone and assign sanctions.  Sanctions include:

  * A formal warning
  * A temporary ban on gaming
  * A temporary ban from Discord
  * A permanent ban on gaming
  * A permanent ban from Discord
  * A permanent ban from Zargon
  * Other restorative actions that are deemed appropriate: e.g. replacing a
    damaged game

A simple majority of arbiters must agree on any sanction.  The exception to that
rule is a permanent ban from Zargon.  That decision must be unanimous.

Note that sanctions may be applied to either party as the arbiters see fit.
Refusal by any party to accept the arbiters' decision gracefully will result in
further and more severe sanction.  The mediator will be responsible for
overseeing the application of any sanctions, and any sanctions applied will only
be made known publicly if they are permanent.  All participants are expected to
refrain from gossip.

### [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)

#### [Our Pledge](#our-pledge)
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to
make participation in our community a consent based, harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal

#### [Our Standards](#our-standards)
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by members include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
